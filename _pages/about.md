Andrea Munafo serves as a Senior Researcher at the University of Pisa while simultaneously spearheading research initiatives on Robotic Autonomy and Perception at SeeByte Ltd. With over 15 years of specialised expertise in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, he has contributed significantly to various national and international research endeavours.

Between 2013 and 2017, Andrea led a cutting-edge research group focused on robotics and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) at NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). Under his leadership, the team developed innovative solutions in robotic localisation, navigation systems, and autonomous sensor networks. He was also instrumental in devising a groundbreaking real-time signal processing chain for active sonar, which remains a cornerstone of CMRE's scientific capabilities.

Andrea's contributions to the field have earned him the NATO Outstanding Scientific Achievements Award twice, in 2017 and 2021. From 2017 to 2019, he served as the Head of Robotics Software at the UK's National Oceanography Centre (NOC), leading groundbreaking research on cooperative robotic networks and autonomous control systems for extreme environments. Notably, he was pivotal in designing an advanced autonomy system for the NOC's Autosub Long Range (ALR) vehicle, which recently completed a record-breaking, month-long autonomous expedition off the coast of Ireland.

In 2019, Andrea transitioned to a Senior Visiting Fellow role at the NOC, where he continued to innovate in the fields of autonomous control and navigation. Later that year, he joined SeeByte, where his focus has been on research in Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence. His collaborative research with Prof. Helen Hastie of Heriot-Watt University was honoured with a multi-million Prosperity Partnership grant in 2021, a prestigious UK government grant aimed at fostering industry-academic collaborations for transformative research.

Since November 2021, Andrea has been affiliated with the University of Pisa, conducting research on distributed sonar processing and shared autonomy, continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible in his field.
